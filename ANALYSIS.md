# Detailed Analysis and Findings

## Motivation
The financial market is influenced by a multitude of factors, from economic indicators to geopolitical events. Investors need predictive tools that can incorporate these various influences. This project focuses on the impact of public sentiment, particularly the influence of Elon Musk's tweets, on Tesla's stock prices.

## Data Collection
We sourced our data from multiple platforms:
- **Tweets:** Extracted from financial news Twitter accounts and Elon Musk's official account.
- **Stock Prices:** Historical data from Yahoo Finance for Tesla and its competitors.
- **Wikipedia Page Views:** Weekly views of Tesla's Wikipedia page to gauge public interest.

### Data Cleaning
Using the Beautiful Soup library, we cleaned the tweets by removing duplicates, URLs, and @mentions. We ensured the data from all features aligned with the dates of Tesla's stock prices.

### Sentiment Analysis
We utilized the VADER sentiment analysis tool to assign sentiment scores to each tweet, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This allowed us to gauge the overall sentiment trends regarding Tesla.

In the features_collection file we obtain a dataframe that contains:

    'Tesla Stock Price': tesla_historical_stock_prices,
    
    'S&P 500 Variance': sp500_variance_df['S&P 500 Variance'],
    
    'Tesla Wikipedia Page Views': wiki_data_df['Tesla Motors[en]']
    
    Tesla's competitors:
    
      'Ford Stock Price': ford_historical_stock_prices,
      
      'GM Stock Price': gm_historical_stock_prices,
      
      'Toyota Stock Price': toyota_historical_stock_prices,
      
      'Nissan Stock Price': nissan_historical_stock_prices,


In the tweets.py file we read the tweets from the files, and in sentimentanalysis.py we develop the sentiment analysis by using the VADER library, which gives a compund score for each tweet based on the words in it. (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/tree/master/vaderSentiment)

The we add these sentiment scores as a weekly average in the features_collection.py file, where the datframe features contains all the features for each week for the years 2010-2021.
    
### Predictive Modeling
#### Regression Models
We used several models to predict Tesla's stock prices:
- **Linear Regression:** Initially used all features but refined the model to eliminate multicollinearity.
- **Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest:** Implemented with cross-validation to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting Trees:** Provided the best performance with feature importance analysis.

#### Classification Models
To predict whether the stock price would go up or down, we used:
- **Baseline Model:** Predicted stock increase for any observation.
- **CART and Random Forest Classifiers:** Implemented with cross-validation.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier:** Showed improved prediction accuracy.

### Results
The models demonstrated that tweets' sentiments significantly impact Tesla's stock prices. Specifically, tweets from influential accounts like Elon Musk's showed a strong correlation with stock price movements.

### Conclusion and Future Work
The integration of sentiment analysis into stock price prediction models offers a comprehensive tool for investors. Future work could involve more granular sentiment analysis from individual Twitter accounts to refine the predictive accuracy.

### Impact
Our project underscores the importance of considering public sentiment in financial modeling. By expanding the scope of analysis, investors can gain deeper insights into the factors driving stock price movements.
